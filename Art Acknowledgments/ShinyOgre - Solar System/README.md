## File Re-Saved to Save Space

Note that the original `space.png` file was 33.2MiB.

This appears to be due to lack of compression, since saving it again (without modifying it) in [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) (version 4.2.16, with bit depth set to "auto-detect" and the interlaced option unchecked) reduced the file size down to 6.59MiB.

To save space in this repository, the re-saved version of the image was kept.

There should be no difference between the image saved in this repository and the image available on [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/).

However, for transparency, the fact the image has been re-saved has been mentioned here, and file hashes are provided below.
