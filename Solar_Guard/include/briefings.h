/* Solar Guard by Deft Spade
 * Using Butano by GValiente
 * Made for GBA JAM 2021
 * Source Code and Assets Licensed Under GPL-3.0
 * 
 * This source code has known issues. No promises are made as to the
 * quality/reliability of anything in this source code. Such issues
 * include and are not necessarily limited to code repetition, magic
 * numbers, undocumented conventions for what certain variable values
 * mean, etc. Lots of refactoring and commenting/documenting is needed
 * to bring the overall code quality up-to-scratch, after all, this was
 * developed as fast as possible within 3 months for a game jam. Also,
 * there are no guarantees about how much I'll further develop this
 * game after GBA JAM 2021. This means I may never get around to fully
 * fixing/completing everything.
