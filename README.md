# Solar Guard
A [homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)) [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) game made for [GBA Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam21).

The game is intended to be a space shooter where you complete various missions in the solar system.

This game is currently under active development (i.e. any build thus far can be considered a development version).

This game was made using [GValiente](https://github.com/GValiente)'s [Butano](https://github.com/GValiente/butano) engine (and the menus use a font from Butano's examples).

> Butano is a modern C++ high level engine for the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance).
