# Solar Guard
A homebrew Game Boy Advance game made for GBA Jam 2021.

The plan is for the game to be a space shooter where you roam the solar system and defend it from attacking forces.

The game is under early development at this stage so anything about the game (e.g. the above plan) is subject to change.
