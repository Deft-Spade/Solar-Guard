# Solar Guard
A homebrew Game Boy Advance game made for GBA Jam 2021.

The plan is for the game to be a space shooter where you roam the solar system completing various missions.

The game is under early development at this stage so various aspects of the game (e.g. the aforementioned plan) may change.
